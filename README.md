# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

## Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means clustering. This segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better and enables targeted marketing strategies.
## Data Used
- <a href="https://github.com/ChandanKumarIIITK/Customer_Saegemantation_Analysis/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_Analysis_Github/Mall_Customers.csv">Dataset</a>
## Power BI Questions: 
1. What are the different customer segments based on spending patterns and income levels?
2. How does age impact customer spending scores?
3. What are the characteristics of high-value customers?
4. How can businesses use segmentation to improve customer engagement and sales?

## Process of the Project: Ola Data Analysis
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing : Used the "Mall_Customers.csv" dataset containing customer demographics, income, and spending score. Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Visualized customer distributions using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.Identified correlations between income, spending score, and age.
3. K-Means Clustering Implementation : Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method. Applied K-Means clustering to group customers based on spending score and income. Visualized clusters using scatter plots.
4. Insights & Interpretation : Analyzed cluster characteristics to identify high-spending, budget-conscious, and average customers.Provided recommendations for targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Insights:
1. Customers can be segmented into different groups based on their income and spending behavior.
2. Young customers with high spending scores are potential targets for premium products.
3. Customers with low spending scores but high income may need different engagement strategies to increase their purchases.
4. Middle-income customers with balanced spending habits can be targeted with loyalty programs.

## Learning Experience:
1. Gained a deeper understanding of customer segmentation techniques.
2. Improved proficiency in K-Means clustering and data visualization.
3. Learned how to use clustering results to make business decisions.
4. Enhanced skills in exploratory data analysis and feature selection.

## Project Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates how K-Means clustering can be applied to customer segmentation. The insights derived from clustering can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer relationships. Future work can involve applying other clustering techniques such as DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering for comparison and refinement of results.
